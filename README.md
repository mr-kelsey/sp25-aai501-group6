# Group 6 final project for AAI-501

This project is a part of the AAI-501 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD).

-- Project Status: [Planned, Active, On-hold, **Completed**]

#### Installation
You should add an instruction how this project is to be used, installed, run, edited in othersâ€™ machine.
 
#### Project Intro/Objective

The main purpose of this project is to learn and apply convolutional neural networks.  Our team will be taking two different approaches.  We will hand-code a CNN and we will build out a CNN using the popular machine learning library: TensorFlow.  Each model will trained on the FER2013 dataset and will attempt to recognize the appropriate emotion given a picture of a given facial expression.

#### Project Abstract
The human face is comprised of roughly sixty muscles and is capable of conveying a multitude of complex emotions.  As such, a large portion of human communication is conveyed through facial expressions. Unfortunately, not everyone can discern what is meant by various facial expressions.  This leaves those who struggle with this skill in a state of confusion, often resulting in them being ostracized from large swaths of society.  Computer-aided facial expression recognition would be greatly beneficial to anyone who struggles with such a task and could help affected persons become more sociable, leading to a higher quality of life.
